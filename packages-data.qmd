## Packages

We are going to work with the following R packages - run the code in R to install them:

```{r packages}
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("tidyverse",
                   "marginaleffects",
                   "performance",
                   "ordinal",
                   "rms",
                   "glmmTMB",
                   "lme4",
                   "DHARMa",
                   "MatchIt",
                   "cobalt"))
```

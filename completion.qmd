To successfully complete this course, students will produce a report in which they perform data analysis using the techniques taught in this course.

The source of data can be either the [Tidytuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) or, after consultation, students can also use their own data (e.g. for a bachelor's/diploma thesis).
